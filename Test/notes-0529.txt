ch 2 basic structures
	1. sets
	2. functions
	3. sequences
	4. sums
	5. matrixes



1. sets
	- unordered collection of objects
	- objects in a set are called elements/members
	- use notation a E A (a belongs to A)
	- use notation a /E/ A (a does not belong to A)
	- order does not matter
	- repeated members of the set does not count
		- ie {1, 3, 2, 5} == {1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 5}
	- symbols for commonly used sets:
		1. N  => natural numbers
		2. Z  => integers
		3. Z+ => positive integers
		4. R  => real numbers
		5. R+ => positive real numbers
		6. C  => complex numbers
		7. Q  => rational numbers
	- set builder notation
		- S = {x | condition for x}
		- S = {x | x is a prime positive integer less than 10}
			- O = {x E Z+ | x is odd and x < 100}
		- able to use predicates
		- S = {x | P(x)}
		- positive rational numbers:
			- Q+ = {x E R | x = p/q, p,q E Z+}
	- interval notation
		- closed [] => inclusive
		- open () => exclusive
	- universal sets U
		- set containing everything currently under consideration
	- empty set 0 or {}
		- set containing no elements
		- 0 != {0}
	- set equality
		- Vx(x E A <-> x E B)
		- {1, 3, 2} == {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2}
	- subsets
		- A is a subset of B, if and only if every element of A
		  is an element of B
		- A (C_) B == Vx(x E A -> x E B}
	- proper subsets
		- if A (C_) B, but A != B, A is a proper subset of B
		- denoted by A (C) B
		- Vx(x E A -> x E B) && 3x(x E B && x /E/ A)
		- ex. let A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {1, 2, 3, 4}
		- A (C) B, i.e. there's an element in B that does not
		  belong in A
	- set cardinality
		- cardinality of set A = |A| is the number of distinct
		  elements of A
		- |0| = 0
		- |{1, 2, 3}| = 3
		- |{0}| = 1
	- power sets
		- set of all subsets of set A is P(A)
		- let A = {a, b},
		  P(A) = {0, {a}, {b}, {a, b}}
	- tuples
		- ordered n-tuples (a1, a2, a3, ..., aN)
	- cartesian products
		- denoted A x B
		- set of ordered pairs (a,b) where
		  a E A and b E b
		- A x B = {(a, b) | a E A && b E B}
		- subset R of the cartesian product A x B
		  is called a Relation from the set A to the set B
	- truth sets of quantifiers
		- given predicate P and domain D, we define the 
		  truth set of P to be set of the elements in D
		  for which P(x) is true
		- the truth set of P(x) is defined as:
		  {x E D | P(x)}

set operations
	1. union
	2. intersection
	3. complementation
	4. difference
	
1. operations
	- union
		- A U B
		- {x | x E A || x E B}
	- intersection
		- A n B
		- {x | x E A && x E B}
	- complement
		- A^c
		- {x | x E U | x /E/ A}
	- difference
		- A - B == A n B^c
		- {x | x E B && x /E/ B}
