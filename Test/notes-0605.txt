2.3 Functions
  
  def:
    - a function f from A to B denoted:
        - f: A -> B
    - assignment of each element in A to exactly one element in B
    - A is the domain of f
    - B is the co-domain of f
  
  injections
    - a function f is said to be 1:1 or injective iff. f(a) = f(b)
      implies that a = b for all a & b in the domain of f
  
  surjections
    - a function is onto or surjective iff. for every element b in B,
      there is an element a in A with f(a) = b

  bijections
    - a function is a 1:1 correspondence or a bijection if it
      is both surjective and injective

  inverse function
    - let f be a bijection from A to B, then the inverse of f is the 
      function from B to A denoted f^-1(y) = x iff. f(x) = y

  2.4 sequences & summations
    
    sequences
      - ordered lists of elements
      - a function from a subset of integers to a set S
    
    strings
      - finite sequence of characters from a finite set (alphabet)
      - empty string is represented by lambda

    recurrence relations
      - a recurrence relation for the sequence {An} is an equation that
        expresses An in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence
      - a sequence is called a solution of the recurrence relation if its terms
        statisfy the recurrence relation
      - the initial condition specify the terms that preced the first term where
        the recurrence relation takes effect.
