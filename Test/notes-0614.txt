ch 3 algorithms

  def.
    finite set of precise instructions for performing a computation
    or for solving a problem

  properties of an algorithm
    1. input
      - input values from a specified set
    2. output
      - produces output values from the input values
    3. correctness
      - should produce correct output values for each set of input values
    4. finiteness
      - should produce the output after a finite number of steps for any input
    5. effectiveness
      - must be possible to perform each step of the algorithm correctly
        in a finite amount of time
    6. generality
      - algorithm should work for all problems of the desired form

    linear search:
    - locates an item in a list of elements in the sequence once at a time
  
    binary search:
    - assume the list of elements is sorted in increasing order
      1. let i := 1, j := n
      2. while i < j:
            m := floor((i + j) / 2)
            if x > am then i := m + 1
            else j := m
      3. if x = ai then return i
         else return 0
