number theory

    divisibility and modular arithmetic:

    1. division:
      - def: if a, b are ints with a != 0,
             then a divides b if there exists
             an int c such that b = a
    
      - a | b => a divides b => b/a

      - properties:
        - if a | b & a | c, then a | (b + c)
        - if a | b , then a | bc for all ints c
        - if a | b & b | c, then a | c

      - division algorithm:
        - d: divisor
        - a: divident
        - q: quotient
        - r: remainder

        - div: q = a div d
        - mod: r = a mod d
          ex. 11 div 3 = 3, 11 mod 3 = 2
              -11 div 3 = -4, -11 mod 3 = 1

      - congruence relation
        - if a, b are ints and m is a ints+, then
          a is congruent to b modulo m if m divides (a - b)
        - notation a = b (mod m), a is congruent to b modulo m
        - a = b (mod m) is a congruence and m is its modulus
          ex. 17 = 5 (mod 6) because 6 divides 17 - 5 = 12
              24 != 14 (mod 6) since 24 - 14 = 10 is not divisible by 6

      - arithmetic modulation
        - +m operation: defined as A +m B = (A + B) mod m
        - *m operation: defined as A *m B = (A * B) mod m
        - satisfies many of the same properties as addition and multiplication
