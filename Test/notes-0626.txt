primes and greatest common divisors

  primes
    - positive integer > 1, and is only divisible
      by itself and 1
    - otherwise it is called composite

    representing functions
      - prime numbers of form 2^p - 1, where p is prime
        are called mersenne primes.
        ex. 2^2 - 1 = 3, 2^7 - 1 = 127

    prime number theorem
      - ratio of the number of primes not exceeding x
        and x/lnx approaches 1 as x grows without bound

    twin prime conjecture
      - there are infinitely many pairs of twin primes
      - twin primes are pair of primes that differ by 2
        ex. (2, 3), (5,7), (11, 13)

  greatest common divisors
    - let a, b != 0, the largest integer d that (d | a) && (d | b)
      is called the greatest common divisor of a and b (gcd)
      ex. gcd(24, 36) = 12
          gcd(17, 22) = 1

    - integers a, b are relatively prime if their gcd is 1 (pairwise relatively prime)
    
  least common multiple
    - lcm of positive integers a, b is the smallest positive integer that is 
      divisible by both a and b.
